I wase able to complete most of the CSS and HTML basic videos on my own,
For some of the bootstrap and javascript exercises I did have to use the video solutions. Particularly for the fetching JS exercise, although I found it much more helpful to go through the video solutions as opposed to simply viewing the solutions. I found it very helpful to see a step by step explanation, and being able to review the lectures via the videos made it a bit easier as well.
I found the flexbox and CSS grid, as well as the bootstrap grid exercises particularly helpful when understanding these concepts, it was much easier to follow during implementation as opposed to the lecture or slides. Especially for the bootstrap section, being able to practice referencing the online documentation when implementing solutions was very helpful, and it felt like a good exercise in finding the correct information onlne via the resources given. I did have to view the videos for the last bit of the bootstrap grid (exercise 3), but I still found it helpful to look at the documentation alongside the video
I feel like everythign was explained fairly well throughout the slides and the reference material provided throughout each week, and having the videos/solutions as a fallback made it much easier to not get lost. The lectures that I did watch had clear and consice explanations of how the solutions where being implemented.
Overall I think the covered exercises really demonstrated how each individaul technology works together and really builds upon each other, especially working through CSS. I found it particularly enjoyable to experience a framework like bootsrap, after learning the basics of CSS and seeing how the framework shortens our code. I will definitely be using some in the final project in order to get more familiar in using the framework for a web page I am to design personally!
